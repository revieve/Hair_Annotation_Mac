# Hair_Annotation_Mac

Requirements:

I am using Python version - 3.7.9, I think it should work with slightly earlier version as well.

Install the below mentioned package in your working python environment

PyQT5 - Version 5.15.1 - https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/

PyQT5-tools- Version 5.15.1.2 - https://pypi.org/project/pyqt5-tools/

opencv-python-headless - Version 4.4.0.46 - https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/

Once you installed those package, then run the following in the terminal

python main.py
